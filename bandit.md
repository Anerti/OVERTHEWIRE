# Level 0 ---> Level 1

The password of the next level can be found in the `/home/$USER` once logged on the remote server.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "bandit0" ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "grep 'password' *"

```

- `#!/bin/bash` is a 'shebang' that tell the local machine what interpreter to use before executing the script.
- `sshpass` is a command that simulate user interaction on the terminal by injecting the password provided after the `-p` option.
- `ssh` is a command used to connect to remote server by providing the username and domain name separated by '@' of the remote machine. Since the ssh service doesn't run on the default port 22, the -p option tell which port is used. The argument between "" execute the command specified once logged.
- `grep` is a command used to search for a pattern on one or more files.
- `*` is a wildcard that can replace any character or string.

The password you are looking for is: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
```

# Level 1 ---> Level 2

The password of the next level can be found in a file named `-`.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    sshpass -p "ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If" ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat < -"
    
```
- Since `-` is used to precise the argument of a command, reading a file with name that begin with `-` can be an issue. The `<` is a file descriptor that redirect the standart input to the cat command. Another method is using the relative `./-` or absolute path `/home/$USER/-` of the file.

```
- This level is like the previous level but the filename now contains spaces.To solve this, the filename can be wrapped around `''` or usins escaping characters `--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--`.

```
- `$()` syntax is used to execute the command between it before passing the output to another command. The escape character is used to avoid the local shell executing the command between it.
- The find command is used to search a file into a specified directory that will be provided by `$(ls)`. The `-type f` flag is used to tell the command to search all file in the specified directory. The `-iname '.*'` and `-exec cat {} +` flag is used respectively to tell the command to search a file with the name begining with `.` and execute the command provided that will print the password of the next level in the shell.

```
- The file command provided after -exec flag is used to determine the type of file the user deal with.
- `|` is a pipe used to pass the output of the find command to be the input of the grep command.
- The cut command is used to parse the output of a command delimited by `:` and take only the first field.

# Level 5 ---> Level 6

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable

```bash

```

- `-size` flag is used to tell the command to search only a file with 1033 bytes.
- `-executable` flag is a flag used to search for all executable file in the specified directory. Since `-not` is provided before it, all files that is not executable is expected as the output.

exec cat {} + 2> /dev/null"
```

- The `-user` and `-group` option is used respectively to search for all files owned by bandit7 and where the user group is bandit6.
- `2>` is used to redirect all errors like `permission denied` into the black hole `/dev/null`. That means that any errors isn't printed on the screen.

    sshpass -p "4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM" ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "strings data.txt | grep ==="
```

- Unlike `cat`, `strings` command only display human-readable strings. Another alternative is to use `-a` option of `grep` that tells the command to treat binary file as ascii text `grep -a === "data.txt"` but since the output contains binary data, some character is not printable in the terminal and the first option is prefered.

```

- `mktemp` with `-d` option is used to create a temporary directory. Once created, the name of the temporary directory is stocked in a bash variable `DIR`.
- `&&` is used to chain command only if the first command succeed.
- `cd` is uded to mote to the temporary directory.
- `cp` is a command used to copy a the file `/home/$USER/data.txt` to the temporary directory created previously.
- `xxd` is a command to represent a file to hexadecimal format or make the reverse process with `-r` option.
- `gzip` and `bzip2` are used to compress a file or make the reverse process with `-d` option.
- `tar` is an archive utility used here to extract an archive `-x` directly to the standart output `-O`. The `-v` option tells the command to be verbose.

```

- `scp` stand for secure copy that permit to download a file based on his absolute path from remote machine to the local machine. Since ssh doesn't run on the default port 22, `-P` option specify the port.
- `echo` display a line of text and the `-e` option enable the interpretation of backslash.

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Private key downloaded to /home/anerti/
```

# Level 14 ---> Level 15

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

*notice: This level depends on the previous level because the sshkey.private file need to be downloaded to /home/$USER*

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    chmod 600 /home/$USER/sshkey.private && ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i /home/$USER/sshkey.private "nc -v localhost 30000 < /etc/bandit_pass/\$USER"
```

- `chmod` change the file permission to set read and write permission for the owner (`600`) of the file provided. If the permission is not correctly set, An issue will occurs during the ssh connection.
- The `-i` option tell ssh to use the private key provided instead of using a password to login
- `nc` enable UDP or TCP connection to a machine in the same network. `-v` option tell the command to make verbose output, the `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` is the ip address of a local machine and 30000 is the port in which to connect. Once the connection is established, the file located in `/etc/bandit_pass/$USER` will be sent. Another alternative is to use `telnet`.

Connection to localhost (127.0.0.1) 30000 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Correct!
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
```

# Level 15 ---> Level 16

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo" ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "ncat --ssl localhost 30001 <<< 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo"     
```

- `ncat` is like `nc` but the communication can be encrypted with ssl by using `--ssl` option to communicate to https server according to the [Official documentation](https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/ncat-ssl.html). 
- Another method is using `openssl` to submit the password over ssl/tls encrypted communication `openssl s_client localhost:30001`. According to the man page `s_client` option implements a generic SSL/TLS client which can establish a transparent connection to a remote server speaking SSL/TLS. Once the connection is established, the password must be submited manually. 

```

# Level 16 ---> Level 17

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx" ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "DIR=\$(mktemp -d) && nmap localhost -p 31000-32000 -oG \$DIR/target && for port in \$(grep -oE '[0-9]{5}' \$DIR/target); do ncat --ssl localhost \$port <<< 'kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx'; done" 
```

- nmap (Network Mapper) is a tool commonly used to discover hosts and scan their ports. In this script, `localhost` is the target, and `-p 31000â€‘32000` specifies the range of ports to scan. The `-oG` option tells `nmap` to save the results in a greppable format to `$DIR/target`.
- The loop `for port in $PORTS; do COMMAND; done` repeats a command for each port found by the scan. The ports are extracted from the greppable output using `grep -oE '[0-9]{5}'`, which matches fiveâ€‘digit numbers. For each extracted port, the command `ncat --ssl localhost $port <<< 'kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx'` is executed, sending the password over an SSLâ€‘encrypted connection.
