# Level 0 ---> Level 1

The password of the next level can be found in the `/home/$USER` once logged on the remote server.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "bandit0" ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "grep 'password' *"

```

- `#!/bin/bash` is a 'shebang' that tell the local machine what interpreter to use before executing the script.
- `sshpass` is a command that simulate user interaction on the terminal by injecting the password provided after the `-p` option.
- `ssh` is a command used to connect to remote server by providing the username and domain name separated by '@' of the remote machine. Since the ssh service doesn't run on the default port 22, the -p option tell which port is used. The argument between "" execute the command specified once logged.
- `grep` is a command used to search for a pattern on one or more files.
- `*` is a wildcard that can replace any character or string.

The password you are looking for is: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
```

# Level 1 ---> Level 2

The password of the next level can be found in a file named `-`.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    sshpass -p "ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If" ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat < -"
    
```
- Since `-` is used to precise the argument of a command, reading a file with name that begin with `-` can be an issue. The `<` is a file descriptor that redirect the standart input to the cat command. Another method is using the relative `./-` or absolute path `/home/$USER/-` of the file.

# Level 2 ---> Level 3

The password of the next level can be found in a file named `--space in this filename--` in the `/home/$USER` directory.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx" ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat < '--spaces in this filename--'" 
```
- This level is like the previous level but the filename now contains spaces.To solve this, the filename can be wrapped around `''` or usins escaping characters `--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--`.

# Level 3 ---> Level 4

The password of the next level is in an hidden file in the `/home/$USER` directory.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx" ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "find \$(ls) -type f -iname '.*' -exec cat {} +"
```
- `$()` syntax is used to execute the command between it before passing the output to another command. The escape character is used to avoid the local shell executing the command between it.
- The find command is used to search a file into a specified directory that will be provided by `$(ls)`. The `-type f` flag is used to tell the command to search all file in the specified directory. The `-iname '.*'` and `-exec cat {} +` flag is used respectively to tell the command to search a file with the name begining with `.` and execute the command provided that will print the password of the next level in the shell.

# Level 4 ---> Level 5

The password of the next level can be found in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.

```bash

    sshpass -p "2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ" ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat \$(find ./inhere -type f -exec file {} + | grep -i ascii | cut -d ':' -f1)"

```
- The file command provided after -exec flag is used to determine the type of file the user deal with.
- `|` is a pipe used to pass the output of the find command to be the input of the grep command.
- The cut command is used to parse the output of a command delimited by `:` and take only the first field.

# Level 5 ---> Level 6

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw" ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "find . -type f -size 1033c -not -executable -exec cat {} +" 
```

- `-size` flag is used to tell the command to search only a file with 1033 bytes.
- `-executable` flag is a flag used to search for all executable file in the specified directory. Since `-not` is provided before it, all files that is not executable is expected as the output.

# Level 6 ---> Level 7

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties: owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, 33 bytes in size.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash


    sshpass -p "HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG" ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -
exec cat {} + 2> /dev/null"
```

- The `-user` and `-group` option is used respectively to search for all files owned by bandit7 and where the user group is bandit6.
- `2>` is used to redirect all errors like `permission denied` into the black hole `/dev/null`. That means that any errors isn't printed on the screen.

```

- `sort` command is used to sort alphabetically the output of the previous command `cat`.
- `uniq` can report or omit repeated lines and `-u` option display on the screen uniques lines. `uniq -u` work only if all lines are sorted.

```

# Level 9 ---> Level 10

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several â€˜=â€™ characters.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM" ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "strings data.txt | grep ==="
```

- Unlike `cat`, `strings` command only display human-readable strings. Another alternative is to use `-a` option of `grep` that tells the command to treat binary file as ascii text `grep -a === "data.txt"` but since the output contains binary data, some character is not printable in the terminal and the first option is prefered.

```

# Level 10 ---> Level 11

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey" ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "base64 -d data.txt"
```

- Base64 encoding is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into an ASCII string format. The `base64` command is a built-in linux command that allow encode/decode data and print to standard output. By default this command encode data provided from input into a basse64 and `-d` option do the reverse operation.

# Level 11 ---> Level 12

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

```bash

    sshpass -p "dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr" ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M' < data.txt" 
```

- Rotating characters by x positions is called Caesar cipher. The `tr` command allow translating or deleting characters. Here the command is tasking to replace a to n, b to m, c to o ... and the same operation applies to uppercase character from the provided input `data.txt`. But digit remains unchanged.
