# Level 0

The password of the next level can be found in the `/home/$USER` once logged on the remote server.

```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    sshpass -p "bandit0" ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "grep 'password' *"
```

- `#!/bin/bash` is a 'shebang' that tell the local machine what interpreter to use before executing the script.
- `sshpass` is a command that simulate user interaction on the terminal by injecting the password provided after the `-p` option.
- `ssh` is a command used to connect to remote server by providing the username and domain name separated by '@' of the remote machine. Since the ssh service doesn't run on the default port 22, the -p option tell which port is used
